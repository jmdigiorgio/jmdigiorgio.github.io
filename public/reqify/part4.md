Without running centrality analysis, it's pretty clear and should be unsurprising that *system* is one of the most central nodes. That word tends to get used quite a bit in requirements specs. This graph, while imperfect, is still a model of a document. Imagine if engineering design artifacts were all developed as models prior to assembly as documents. Imagine being able to follow a thread from one idea to another by following edges between nodes. Imagine being able to add metadata at the atomic level. When a document is authoritative, important and subject to the efforts of teams of people and possibly hundreds of revisions, imagine git-styled versioning rather than a dozen variations of the following spread out across a dozen computers:

``` json
document_final.docx
document_final_final.docx
document_final_v2_draft.docx
```
